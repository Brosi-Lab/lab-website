This week, the Brosi Lab was in charge of leading Ecoseminar! Berry gave a brief overview of our lab’s work, followed by four lightning talks from Annie, Chris, Madeleine, and Manogya. This quarter in Ecoseminar we’ve been hearing from all the ecology labs about their ongoing research — it's been a blast chatting about science and building 4th floor community!
