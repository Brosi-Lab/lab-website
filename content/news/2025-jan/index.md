The Lab received a new grant from the OneHive Foundation supporting the expansion of the MeadoWatch program to include pollinator monitoring! In addition to plant phenology data, volunteers of the program will now be able to observe and collect data on plant-pollinator interactions at Mt Rainier National Park. We will be recruiting a cohort of volunteers to test out our new protocol in 2025. Follow us on instagram @meadowatch for more updates!
