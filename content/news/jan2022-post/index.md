Congratulations to Laura for receiving an Agricultural and Food Research Initiative New Investigator Seed Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture! This year the program awarded 10 grants to support research to sustain healthy pollinator populations in agricultural settings and address the issue of pollinator declines. With this award, Laura will study the effects of broadcast-spray agricultural antibiotics on bee microbiome and foraging behavior. She will carry out lab experiments at Emory University and fieldwork at pear orchards in Washington State. This is also Lauraâ€™s first large grant as PI. Great job, Laura!
