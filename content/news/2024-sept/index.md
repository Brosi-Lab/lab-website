Thanks to everyone who participated in our [Integrating Theory and Data in Plant-Pollinator Interactions](https://models4data2theory.github.io/thanks/) workshop held at RMBL last week! Berry instructed this workshop alongside several of our NSF collaborators (Dr. Fernanda Valdovinos, Dr. Mark Novak, Dr. Ian Breckheimer, and Dr. Taranjot Kaur) and the event was a great success. Participants spent 3 days in the Rocky Mountains exploring the theory of network structure, the statistical methods for model fitting, and the mathematical tools that enable inferences regarding community dynamics. We are super excited to host this workshop again in 2025!
