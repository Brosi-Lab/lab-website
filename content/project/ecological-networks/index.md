We are broadly interested in how the structure of ecological networks affects their stability and functioning, how networks respond to perturbations, and more generally their dynamics and evolution. Most of our work focuses on mutualistic networks, particularly pollination networks, but we are interested in all kinds of ecological interactions, and especially in combining multiple interaction types in the same network. A particular goal is to better integrate theory and empirical data, an integration that remains rare in mutualistic network studies.
