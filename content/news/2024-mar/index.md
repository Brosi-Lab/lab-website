We are happy to advertise that the lab has acquired new shared-use microscope equipment available for use by any UW student, faculty, or staff member! This includes a dissecting microscope, compound microscope, and a high-quality color camera fittable to both. Berry, Madeleine, and Manogya (along with other department members) applied for and were awarded this equipment through the [UW Student Technology Fund](https://techfee.uw.edu/). We are incredibly excited to use these microscopes and camera to improve our insect ID and help train new lab members! If you are a member of the UW community interested in using this equipment, contact Manogya (mchandar@uw.edu) to attend a training session.
