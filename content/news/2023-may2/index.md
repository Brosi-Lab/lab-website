A huge congratulations to Kaysee Arrowsmith for successfully defending and completing her dissertation! She gave an amazing presentation on the biotic and abiotic drivers of plant-pollinator interaction turnover. Her presence in the Brosi Lab will be missed, but we can’t wait to see where she goes next. We’re so proud of you, Kaysee!
