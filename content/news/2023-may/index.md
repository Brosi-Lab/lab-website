The Brosi Lab was very excited to host Dr. Matt Smith at UW this week! Matt is currently a postdoc in the Crall Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He gave a fascinating talk discussing his research on individuality in insect behavior across individual, social, and environmental scales. He also assisted with the setup of our own “AutoPolls” units (automated pollinator camera systems) which we plan to implement in the field this season. It was great having him!
