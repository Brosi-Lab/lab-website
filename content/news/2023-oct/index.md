Congratulations to Laura Avila (and co-authors Berry and Annie S) for their recent publication on the effects of antibiotics on pollination! This study, published in Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, compared the effects of two fire blight control methods (spraying an antibiotic and a biological antagonist) on honeybee pollination and fruit set, as well as lab experiments to understand the effects of these treatments on foraging behavior. You can read the full paper titled: “Effects of a field-sprayed antibiotic on bee foraging behavior and pollination in pear orchards” [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108757)!
