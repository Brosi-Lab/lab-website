Congratulations to Madeleine and Berry for receiving the UW Program on Climate Change (PCC) Climate Science Research Acceleration Grant! Their project titled “Experimentally induced timing mismatches in multi-species pollination systems” will investigate the systems-level impacts of timing mismatches between plants and pollinators, advancing our understanding of phenological mismatches at the community and species-interaction-network levels. This summer, Madeleine will be looking for potential sites and collecting preliminary data so that we can conduct manipulation experiments next Spring. We are very excited to be conducting more fieldwork in Washington!
