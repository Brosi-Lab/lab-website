This week marked the first ever [North Coast and Cascades Science Days](https://www.nps.gov/rlc/northcoastcascades/science-days.htm) conference hosted by the National Park Service's North Coast and Cascades Research Learning Center. Madeleine and Manogya both presented at this three-day virtual symposium featuring new and ongoing science in the region. Madeleine's talk focused on the effects of tree encroachment on meadow plants and pollinators, discussing her plans for research at Mount Rainier National Park this summer. Manogya's talk focused on the MeadoWatch program and utilizing citizen science to monitor wildflower phenology at Mount Rainier National Park. We hope this is the first of many symposia!
