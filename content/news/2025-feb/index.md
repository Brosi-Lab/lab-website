Congrats to Erica and Madeleine on their excellent lightning talks at this year's North Coast and Cascades Science Days symposium. This was the second ever NCC science days and it was exciting to once again have Brosi Lab research represented! Erica's talk "Uncovering the driving mechanisms of range contractions in bumblebees" addressed exciting upcoming plans for her first Mount Rainier field season. In Madeleine's talk" "Impacts of tree encroachment on meadow plants and pollinators", she presented some compelling preliminary results!
