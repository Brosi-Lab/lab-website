Congratulations to Madeleine for receiving the Robert T. Paine Experimental & Field Ecology Fellowship to conduct fieldwork at Mt Rainier National Park next summer! She will be measuring the impact of tree encroachment on plant-pollinator communities and testing the feasibility of tree sapling removal as a method for meadow habitat conservation. Great job, Madeleine!
