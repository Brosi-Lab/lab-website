Congratulations to Madeleine for passing her general exam and officially becoming a PhD candidate! She successfully presented her dissertation proposal to her committee, discussing her work on shifts in coflowering of meadow plants, DNA metabarcoding of pollen samples, and plans for investigating tree encroachment in the meadows of Mt Rainier this upcoming summer. Amazing job, Madeleine!
