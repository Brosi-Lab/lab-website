Berry presented on [MeadoWatch](www.meadowatch.org) at the Washington Native Plant Society meeting in an exciting 2-part program on Community Science in Cascadia. His talk on MeadoWatch covered past work and findings, as well as our upcoming plans for citizen-science plant-pollinator interaction data collection. Berry presented alongside Dr. Regina Rochefort who gave a talk on the [Cascades Butterfly Project](https://www.nps.gov/articles/cascades-butterfly-project.htm) - another incredible long-term citizen-science program in Washington! What a great way to kick off Native Plant Appreciation Month!
