description: "The Structure and Function of Biodiversity:
We study how the structure of biological communities—including both biodiversity and ecological network structure—affects ecological functioning, and how it is affected by environmental change.
Much of our work uses plant-pollinator interactions as a model system.
We are actively engaged in translating our work and synthesizing other science in the service of environmental policy and management."
