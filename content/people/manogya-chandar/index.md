I am generally interested in exploring the ecological drivers that influence pollinator visitation and foraging decisions. I'm especially interested in studying this from a molecular perspective, and understanding the genetic consequences of pollinator foraging on plant reproduction and fitness. My senior thesis explored the relationship between temperature fluctuation and pollinator niche dynamics in the Rocky Mountains. I'm also interested in community-oriented science, and am  coordinator of the MeadoWatch program!
