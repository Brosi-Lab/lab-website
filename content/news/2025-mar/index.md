A big cangratulations to undergraduate students Stella Christopherson and Jovanna Talarico for their incredible poster titled "Building Plant-Pollinator Networks at Mount Rainier National Park: A Framework for Citizen-Science". They presented the preliminary MeadoWatch pollinator data that they helped Madeleine collect at Mt Rainier this summer. Stella, Jovanna, Madeleine, and Manogya all attended, spending a lovely day learning more about the flora of Washington state and hearing about exciting ongoing local botanical research. We even spotted some early Spring bumblebee queens!
