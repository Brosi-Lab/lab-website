<!-- this is a subheadline -->
We are a Pollination and Community Ecology lab in the [Department of Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington. Take a look around to find out more about our lab and our research!

## Summer 2025 Workshop: Integrating Theory and Data in Plant-Pollinator Interactions
Participate in a 3-day data-theory integration workshop at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab! Dr. Brosi will be instructing this workshop alongside several of our collaborators (Dr. Fernanda Valdovinos, Dr. Mark Novak, Dr. Ian Breckheimer, and Dr. Taranjot Kaur).

With a focus on the structure and dynamics of plant-pollinator interactions, the goals for this workshop are to introduce participants to the theory underlying metrics of network structure, the statistical methods for quantifying interaction processes from data, and the mathematical tools that enable inferences regarding community dynamics.
