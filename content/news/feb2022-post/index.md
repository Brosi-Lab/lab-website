Several lab members have recently published papers or have papers coming out soon! Loy and Berry have a new review paper in press in Ecology: [“The effects of pollinator diversity on pollination function”](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3631)In their paper, they propose a new framework for diversity-function relationships, including two mechanisms in pollination systems. Loy and Berry also contributed to a recent paper in Conservation Biology, [“Conserving alpha and beta diversity in wood-production landscapes”](10.1111/cobi.13872) about changes in biological communities after different types of biomass harvest. Laura, Berry, David Hofmann (in the Emory Physics Department), and Emory undergraduate Libby Dunne have a new paper out in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: [“Upper-limit agricultural dietary exposure to streptomycin in the lab reduces learning and foraging in bumble bees”](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.2514) Their study explored how agricultural antibiotics impacted bee learning, foraging, and stimulus avoidance. Laura will compare the results of this lab study to those in a field study this spring (see our post on Laura’s USDA NIFA grant).
