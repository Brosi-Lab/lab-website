Our lab values work-life balance, a sense of humor and fun, intellectual and scientific rigor, a lack of hierarchy, and open lines of communication. To us, development of human potential and looking out for each other are a key part of what we do.

### We believe in doing great science, and in enjoying the process. Our lab values work-life balance, a sense of humor and fun, intellectual and scientific rigor, a lack of hierarchy, and open lines of communication. To us, development of human potential and looking out for each other are a key part of what we do. This is particularly important given the often strongly critical culture of science in our society, in which failure and rejection are common. Together, we have developed a lab culture that values working together to enjoy the process of science, even when things do not turn out as we had expected.
