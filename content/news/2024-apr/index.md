This week the lab hosted a very successful Biology Coffee Hour featuring a variety of homemade treats, coffee, and community building! Each week, a different lab is in charge of hosting coffee hour in the department. It was a beautiful sunny day to catch up on the LSB deck (and hopefully the first of many sunny and warm coffee hours to come).
