I am an organismal ecologist interested in the mechanistic links between individual behavior and physiology and population-level trends. As an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biology, I am investigating the mechanistic causes of range contractions in bumble bees. I am broadly interested in promoting pollinator and wildlife conservation and sustainable land management, as well as cultivating scientific curiosity and environmental stewardship in our communities.
