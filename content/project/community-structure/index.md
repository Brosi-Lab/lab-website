Understanding how environmental change affects ecological communities is key given the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Much of Berryâ€™s doctoral and post-doctoral work focused on these themes, focused on how tropical deforestation and land-use affect bee communities. We are currently finalizing work on this theme related to land-use changes surrounding biofuel feedstock cultivation in the southeastern US (see project to the right).

NOTE: our work has largely shifted away from this topic; we are unlikely to take on new students or get involved in new projects in this area unless there is a clear link to ecological networks or functioning.
