The [MeadoWatch](http://www.meadowatch.org/) program was recently featured in a Mt Rainier National Park video about research in the park! In the interview, Berry discusses how and why we monitor wildflower phenology at Rainier, as well as the importance of citizen science. The video also features clips of previous MeadoWatch coordinators Annie Schiffer and Ava Kloss-Schmidt collecting data on the trails. You can check out the video titled [“Climate Change Science at Mt Rainier”](https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/nature/climatechange.htm) on Youtube or on the NPS website!
