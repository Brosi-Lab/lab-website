We are very excited to welcome three new undergrad students to the Brosi lab this winter: Emma Wells, Mahika Rao, and Dylan Strauss! This quarter they will learn how to process insect specimens, focusing on pinning, sorting, and IDing pollinators for our Quantitative Nestedness project. Welcome to the Brosi lab!
