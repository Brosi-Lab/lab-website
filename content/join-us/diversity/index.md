excerpt: "Our lab welcomes participants—students, postdocs, visiting scholars, and others—regardless of race, religion, gender identification, sexual orientation, age, or disability status. A key under-represented group in science are participants from low-income backgrounds as well. We actively work to increase equity and inclusion in our lab and in science more generally, because we believe that diverse viewpoints and life experiences are critical for solving tough problems for science and for society. This is one of our key goals, and we weight it equally with doing good science."
